This is a Vulkan experiment for personal use on my Windows 11 development machine.

Please run clippy after each refactor or feature addition.

Please always resolve Vulkan validation layer errors and warnings after any change,
though performance validation layers may be disabled or ignored for now.

Please write code that is as concise as reasonably possible.

Please summarize the issues you ran into along the way.
