This is a modern Vulkan 1.4 app using Vulkanalia. It's for personal use on a Windows 11 development machine,
so we're free to experiment with new Vulkan features.

Please run clippy after each refactor or feature addition.

Please always resolve Vulkan validation layer errors and warnings after any change.

Please write code that is as concise as reasonably possible.

Please summarize the issues you ran into along the way.

Validation layers are enabled for debug builds and configured through vkconfig (Vulkan SDK).

IMPORTANT: Before deciding to make any big changes to the code, let's discuss it first.
